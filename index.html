                <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and
                    policies, and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to
                    Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee
                    camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence
                    from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads
                    and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several universities and public buildings in
                    Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's
                    greatest leader.</p>
